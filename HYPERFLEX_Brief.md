# HYPERFLEX Project Brief — Updated March 11, 2026

> **RULE:** Claude must update this file at the END of every session with what was done, what's committed, and what's next. No exceptions.

## 1. Project Status

**LIVE:** https://hyperflex-production-4294.up.railway.app
**Repo:** Railway auto-deploys from `main` branch on push.

---

## 2. What This Product Is (The Pivot)

HYPERFLEX is a social network for prediction market traders — a platform where users build verified public identities around their forecasting track record, post predictions attached to real money positions with written theses, follow the traders they trust, and trade directly across Polymarket and Kalshi from a single interface. The core thesis is that the social graph of prediction market participants — who follows whom, whose calls others act on, whose reasoning moves markets — doesn't exist anywhere yet, and HYPERFLEX is the only platform positioned to own it. Built on Node.js/Express with a Supabase backend and hosted on Railway, the platform already has Polymarket CLOB trading live, a cross-platform portfolio aggregator, alpha signal engine, Stripe subscriptions, and creator tooling; what's being built now is the social layer — prediction posts, accuracy scoring, and the follow graph — which transforms HYPERFLEX from a trading utility into a network effect business whose data becomes the defensible B2B asset: verified forecaster accuracy by domain, thesis-linked position data, and influence cascade analytics that no exchange, data vendor, or signal bot can replicate.

## 10. Known Issues / Next Up

- **Leaderboard:** Weekly/monthly tabs in community UI not wired to API (only all-time works)
- **Trade pricing:** Scanner-created markets may not have `yes_price`/`no_price` set — defaults may be needed
- **Settlement:** `fetchCurrentPrice()` commodity mapping is rough; scanner categories (crypto, commodities, macro) may not map cleanly to a specific settlement price source
- **Debug logs:** `[scanAndCreateMarkets] inserting` and `[markets fetch] raw response` still in production — noisy
- **Custom domain:** Platinum tier promises custom domain support — not implemented yet
- **`/index.html` at root:** Old React trading app still sitting at project root; should eventually be removed or repurposed

## 11. Dev Workflow

1. Edit files directly in the `~/hyperflex` folder
2. Commit + push → Railway auto-deploys
