## Current State (last updated March 13, 2026)

- All features live on Railway. Latest commit: `dc742bf` (local, not yet pushed)
- **Stripe payments live** — Pro ($29/mo) + Premium ($99/mo) checkout + billing portal
  - Railway env vars needed: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PLATINUM_PRICE_ID`
  - Webhook endpoint registered at: `https://hyperflex.network/stripe/webhook`
  - Webhook events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `customer.subscription.paused`, `customer.subscription.updated`
- **Admin dashboard** at `/admin` — password-gated, creator table, inline plan control
  - Railway env var needed: `ADMIN_SECRET`
- **OAuth**: Google fully working. X/Twitter works (name + username only — Twitter doesn't return email via API)
- **Premium rebrand**: "Platinum" renamed to "Premium" in all UI. DB value stays `'platinum'` — do NOT change DB value.
- **Watermark**: shown on Free + Pro, hidden on Premium only
- **Video section**: added to landing page — replace `VIDEO_ID` in `public/index.html` with real YouTube video ID when ready
- **creator_settings** is the canonical creator table (not `communities`)
- Stripe webhook updates `creator_settings.plan` on checkout + cancellation
- **Flex Points Gamification** (commit `43c70fd`):
  - Streak multipliers in settlement: 3 wins → 1.5×, 5+ wins → 2× payout
  - Streak badges on leaderboards: 🔥 (3+), ⚡ Streak Master (7+)
  - Weekly Power Predictor panel on creator dashboard (Pro/Premium gated)
  - Inner Circle panel on creator dashboard (Premium gated) — members with 2,000+ points
- **Per-Community Points Economy** (commit `c55f856`) — ⚠️ REQUIRES Supabase migration first:
  - `community_balances` table: per-user per-creator balance (centpoints: 100,000 = 1,000 pts)
  - `creator_settings` new columns: `starting_balance`, `min_bet`, `max_bet`, `refill_enabled`, `refill_amount`, `refill_cadence`, `activity_gate`
  - Balance helpers: `getCommunityBalance(userId, slug)`, `setCommunityBalance()`, `getCreatorSlugForMarket()`
  - Settlement (cron + manual) credits `community_balances`, not `users.balance`
  - `GET /api/user/community-balance/:slug` — auth'd endpoint for member balance
  - `GET /api/community/:slug` — now includes `starting_balance`, `min_bet`, `max_bet`
  - `PUT /api/creator/settings` — accepts all economy fields
  - Economy Settings panel on creator dashboard (Settings tab)
  - community.html: shows community balance, enforces min/max bet in UI
  - **CENTPOINTS**: all balances/bets stored as 100× pts. Always divide by 100 for display.
  - **Migration file**: `supabase_migration_community_economy.sql` — run in Supabase SQL editor

## To deploy: `git push origin main` (Claude cannot push — no internet from VM)

## Rules Claude Must Follow Every Session

1. **Read this file + HYPERFLEX_Brief.md + TODO.md at session start** before touching anything
2. **Update all three files at session end** — what was done, what's committed, what's next
3. **Never push** — user pushes from their terminal or Claude Code
4. **Always check git status** before assuming what's deployed vs local
5. **Font/color system:** Syne (display) + Space Mono (mono), gold `#c9920d`, paper `#141412`
6. **DB:** `creator_settings` is the main creator table (not `communities`)
7. **Plan values in DB:** `'free'`, `'pro'`, `'platinum'` — display as Free / Pro / Premium in UI

## The Ask

Marc is the founder. Claude is the CTO. Be proactive, stay in context, don't ask what we're building — you already know. Read the brief, check git status, and get to work.
