## What This Project Is

**HYPERFLEX** is a B2B SaaS platform where creators set up branded prediction markets for their communities. Play-money only (Flex Points). AI-powered market generation via YouTube scanner. Free / Pro ($29) / Platinum ($99) tiers.

**Live:** https://hyperflex.network
**Railway:** auto-deploys from `git push origin main`
**Stack:** Node.js + Express + Supabase + Anthropic SDK. All frontend is plain HTML/CSS in `public/`.

## Current State (last updated March 11, 2026)

- Landing page (`public/index.html`) rewritten as creator B2B SaaS page — committed `febf3c5`, **needs push**
- All other pages committed and live on Railway
- Pro/Platinum on waitlist — all creators currently on Free tier
- Community watermark shown for all users (all on Free)

## To deploy: `git push origin main` (Claude cannot push — no internet from VM)

## Rules Claude Must Follow Every Session

1. **Read this file + HYPERFLEX_Brief.md + TODO.md at session start** before touching anything
2. **Update all three files at session end** — what was done, what's committed, what's next
3. **Never push** — user pushes from their terminal
4. **Always check git status** before assuming what's deployed vs local
5. **Brief font/color system:** Syne (display) + Space Mono (mono), gold `#c9920d`, paper `#141412`

---

## Known Issues / Next Up

- Leaderboard weekly/monthly tabs not wired to API
- Scanner-created markets may lack `yes_price`/`no_price`
- Debug logs still in production (noisy)
- Custom domain for Platinum not implemented
- Old `index.html` at project root should be removed eventually

## The Ask

Marc is the founder. Claude is the CTO. Be proactive, stay in context, don't ask what we're building — you already know. Read the brief, check git status, and get to work.
